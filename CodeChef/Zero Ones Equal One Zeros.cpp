Problem
Kulyash believes in equality.
Given an integer 
�
N, output a binary string of length 
�
N such that:

The count of 
01
01 subsequences in the string is equal to the count of 
10
10 subsequences;
The string has at least one occurrence of 
0
0 as well as 
1
1.
If multiple such strings exist, print any. Also, it is guaranteed that corresponding to the given input, an answer always exists.

Input Format
First line will contain 
�
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, an integer 
�
N - the length of the binary string.
Output Format
For each test case, output any binary string of length 
�
N satisfying the given conditions.

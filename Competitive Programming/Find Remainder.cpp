Problem
Write a program to find the remainder when an integer A is divided by an integer B.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each line contains two Integers A and B.

Output
For each test case, find the remainder when A is divided by B, and display it in a new line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000

Visualization 
Challenge & Selection
The first tool I used was the tool of Visualization, or Visual Thinking, to achieve a shared understanding of a problem space among a diverse group
of stakeholders before attempting to identify and define possible solutions to the problem. I use this approach often with our customers, who are government
agencies working to apply technology innovations to modernize their mission or the delivery of their services to their customer, which may be U.S. citizens,
businesses, and non-citizens. I have used the technique of using a straw man visualization of a problem domain with a set of questions or prompts for discussion
to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to learn from each other in the process of defining the scope, boundaries, key elements, and relationships between elements
to consider when identifying pain points and opportunities for improvements or solutions.
Application 
I start the process by creating a straw man graphic of the problem domain. To develop the straw man graphic, I will draw from any existing
material available to understand the environment. The existing material may be operational or procedural documents, training materials, marketing 
materials, GAO or other auditing reports. If materials are not available, then I conduct informal interviews with one-three of the stakeholders who serve 
as my main points of contact on the initiative. If appropriate to the situation, I will borrow the concept to “front-stage/back-stage” from previous research,
and discussed in David Gray’s book, “The Connected Company”. The front-stage/back-stage approach helps to reinforce the notion that every service – even an internal
service – has customers with whom the service provider interacts and internal processes that enable the organization to provide the service. The template I often start 
with also has a column on the left to identify Partners and Value Chain Providers and a column on the right to identify Oversight Organizations, such as Congress, GAO,
labor unions, advocacy groups, and other entities that may add constraints to how the organization operates. The straw man graphic is simple, using simple shapes and
icons available in Visio or on the Internet. If the front-stage/back-stage view doesn’t work, then I will create a different type of visual, either based on a high-level
process flow with swim lanes for different stakeholders, or another format. For the activity, I will divide the stakeholders into groups of 5-6 participants each 
representing a different organization or area of interest. Each group receives a poster-size copy of the straw man graphic that they can write on directly,
or use sticky notes to make comments. I give them two-three questions to answer, such as: 1) What key elements are missing from the graphic? 2) What would you 
change about the graphic to make it more accurately reflect your problem space? 3) What key insights do you have about the relationships between the entities in
your problem space? I give them approximately 20 minutes to discuss the questions and mark up the graphic. Then I have each group report out on their answers to those
three questions while pointing to the mark-ups on their poster. As each group reports out, I record commonalities in the insights of each group, and then additional
insights that come from the group discussion on an additional copy of the graphic. After the session, I digitize each group’s poster as an artifact, create a view that 
combines the shared and new insights from the group discussion, and then create a revised graphic that incorporates their feedback and proposed changes that they agreed
to as a group. Insight & Approach What I have learned from conducting this exercise with several groups is that while the graphic – especially the revised graphic that
incorporates their feedback – is important for reinforcing their understanding of the problem they are working to solve, the more valuable aspect of the activity is
the shared insights and shared learning that occurs while they are working to define their problem space. The graphic gives the diverse group of stakeholders a focal
point for discussion that allows them to share their perspectives and develop insights into potential root causes of their problems. While they could create the
graphic from a blank slate in a collaborative manner, starting with a straw man jump starts the conversation for them. They can quickly identify where they are in 
the graphic – or if they are missing – and can more quickly gain new insights about relationships between key entities instead of taking time to identify them. 
They can also identify variables in the problem space – that is, it helps them to identify what they don’t know, in what areas they need to obtain information or data
to provide the values for the variables. Since I discovered that the most valuable aspect is the shared insights and learning, next time I would use the visualization 
activity as a starting point for a series of design thinking activities. Then the revised graphic that incorporates their combined feedback can serve as a reference
tool throughout the remainder of their work.
